# N-Queens
N-Queens Puzzle Project

This project is the N-Queens puzzle, where Queens are placed on a chessboard of
N-size so that there is a queen in every row and column, yet they can't attack each other.

This project showcases my understanding and application of recursion in C++ utilizing
backtracking to solve the N-Queens puzzle.
